# Paperbuzz Plugin
Article level metrics plugin for OJS to display in usage metrics on abstract page. Journals that do not assign DOIs will only display download metrics.

Paperbuzz is a free and open service built by [ImpactStory](https://profiles.impactstory.org/) with PKP’s support.  It takes the complex data collected by [Crossref Event Data](https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data/) and calculates metrics for every article that has a digital object identifier (DOI) registered with Crossref.

This development was conducted as part of the [CO.SHS project](co-shs.ca) and has been supported by the Canada Foundation for Innovation (Cyberinfrastructure Initiative – Challenge 1 – First competition).”
